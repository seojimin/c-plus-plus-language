** reflection **
1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.

        If the templated functions exist in Data.cpp, an error will occur while compiling the script.

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?

        I tested to define both, but it did not work.

3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates? 

        It can accept duouble overloading, but the advantge of using templates can accept another type such as long and can disappear a duplicate code.

4. Are the following equivalent?
   template<class T>
   template<typename T>

        Yes

** quizz reflection **
1. (1) Which polymorphism perfects the separation of interfaces from implementation?

-Template


 2. (1) What is a concrete class? 

-Concrete class is a derived class that implements that interface.


3. (1) _______________class inherits a pure virtual function which doesn’t provide an implementation for functions. 

-abstract class


4. (1) A pure virtual member function has multiple definitions within its hierarchy and each definition has the different signatures with the same meaning. 

-true 


5. (1) In ______________ polymorphism the type and the logic executed on that type are independent of one another. 

-Parametric 


6. (1) Define the signature of the pure virtual function in C++. (function name is print). 

- virtual void print() = 0;



7. (1) An interface in C++ is an abstract base class with no data members.

 -true 


8. (1) How does static cast conversion (static_cast(minutes)/ 60;) support in C++? 

a. It rejects conversions between pointer and non-pointer types. 


9. (2) Identify the type of template for the following given codes (a) and (b) and write the answer in each blank.


 (a) ____________int (The template for all functions that swap values in this way follows from replacing the specific type int with the type variable T and inserting the template header)____________________________ 

template void swap(T& a, T& b) { 

T c;

 c = a;

 a = b; 

b = c; } 


(b) ____Array classes of specified size in static memory. The template parameters are the type (T) of each element in the array and the number of elements in the array (N)._____________________________________ 

template class Array { 

T a[N]; 

public: 

T& operator[](int i) { return a[i]; } 

};

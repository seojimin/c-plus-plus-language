Reflection section

1)	Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
Because the self object's value should not be changed.
2)	List how you avoided duplication of code.
We can make a new function of repeated code to avoid duplication.
3)	List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
 learned about how to make a copy object through the copy constructor and assignment operator.

Quiz reflection 

1 (3) Identify the prototypes for the special member functions that need to be defined in a class named
OOP244 if that class accesses resources:
a) OOP244& operator=(const OOP244&);
b) OOP244(const OOP244&);
c) ~OOP244();

2 (1) How would you declare a data member named student in a class named OOP244 that accesses
dynamically allocated memory for an array of Student objects?
Char* name;

3 (2) Write the code snippet that sets an OOP244 object to a safe empty state in a constructor that
validates data received through its parameters and find that data to be invalid:

#include “OOP244.h”
OOP244::OOP244() {
// sets a safe empty state
number = 0;
grade = nullptr;
}

OOP244::OOP244( …, …, …) {
bool valid = …;
If ( valid ) {
// stores valid data in the object
number = data;
grade = data2;
}
else { // add the code here to store a safe empty state
grade = nullptr;
*this = OOP244();
}
}

4 (1) Write a statement that performs a self-assignment
a) Type & operator=(const Type&);

5 (1) Which keyword prohibits the copying or assignment of an object?
a) = delete

6(2) Identify two instructions that need to be coded in the logic of an assignment operator for a class
that accesses resources
a) private member function 
b) direct call

1. How many elements are there in each c-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account? why? 

The size of each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account is 41, because the last character is the end of string ('0') null character. A C-style string is essentially an array of character with the special character null at the end. This character is required, so we must take it into account.

2. Your class declares two member functions named set(…). In C, this would generate an error. Name the feature of C++ that allows this.

Because, this is called function overloading that C++ language allows you to specify more than one definition for a function name in the same scope. When you call an overloaded function , the compiler determines the most appropriate definition to use, by comparing the argument types in the function call to the parameters types in the definition.

3. What have you learned during this workshop?
I learned about to define a class type and how to use a class definition with private data members and public member function through this workshop. Also, how can access data within an object of class type through
public member function and can use standard library facilities to format data inserted into the output stream.

Quix 2 reflection section

5 (1) The width() member function of the ostream class applies to (check one of the following):
- The next field only
6 (3) Add the statement(s) that displays the number e to 4 decimal places on standard output

#include <iostream>

int main() {

double e = 2.71828182845;

std::precision(4);

std::cout << e << std::endl;

}
